You want to get going.\n\nBut there’s a lot more to a good business than a good idea. You need to think things through to maximise your chances of success. Are you the right person to run the business? Will customers like your product?\n\nA business plan will help you turn an idea into a business. It needs you to think through all the parts of your business to plan how everything will work. It will take a few weeks to write if you’re going to do it properly. Some parts will be easier to complete than others.\n\nStick at it because it’s not the final document that’s important, it’s the process. Although you want to have a good plan when you’re done, an OK plan is better than no plan."
